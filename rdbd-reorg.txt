                         draft-brotman-rdbd-03

Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism by which a DNS domain can
   publicly document the existence or absence of a relationship with a
   different domain, called "Related Domains By DNS", or "RDBD".

1.  Introduction

   Determining relationships between DNS domains can be one of the more
   difficult investigations on the Internet.  It is typical to see
   something such as "example.com" and "dept-example.com" and be unsure
   if there is an actual relationship between those two domains, or if
   one might be an attacker attempting to impersonate the other.  In
   some cases, anecdotal evidence from the DNS or WHOIS/RDAP may be
   sufficient.  However, service providers of various kinds may err on
   the side of caution and treat one of the domains as untrustworthy or
   abusive if it is not clear that the two domains are in fact related.
   This specification provides a way for one domain to explicitly
   document, or disavow, a relationship other domains, utilizing DNS
   records.

Internet-Draft                    RDBD                    September 2019


   The use cases for this include:

   o  where an organisation has names below different ccTLDs, and would
      like to allow others to correlate their ownership more easily,
      consider "example.de" and "example.ie" registered by regional
      offices of the same company;

   o  following an acquisition, a domain holder might want to indicate
      that example.net is now related to example.com in order to make a
      later migration easier;

   o  when doing Internet surveys, we should be able to provide more
      accurate results if we have information as to which domains are,
      or are not, related.

   o  a domain holder may wish to declare that no relationship exists
      with some other domain, for example "good.example" may want to
      declare that it is not associated with "g00d.example" if the
      latter is currently being used in some cousin-domain style attack.
      In such cases, it is more likely that there can be a larger list
      of names (compared to the "positive" use-cases) for which there is
      a desire to disavow a relationship.

   It is not a goal of this specification to provide a high-level of
   assurance as to whether or not two domains are definitely related,
   nor to provide fine-grained detail about the kinds of relationships
   that may exist between domains.  However, the mechanism defined here
   is extensible in a way that should allow use-cases calling for such
   declarations to be handled later.

   [[Discussion of this draft is taking place on the dnsop@ietf.org
   mailing list.  Previously, there was discussion on the
   dbound@ietf.org list.  There's a github repo for this draft at
   <https://github.com/abrotman/related-domains-by-dns> - issues and PRs
   are welcome there.]]

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   The following terms are used throughout this document:

   o  Relating-domain: this refers to the domain that is declarating a
      relationship exists.  (This was called the "parent/primary" in
      -00).

Internet-Draft                    RDBD                    September 2019


   o  Related-domain: This refers to the domain that is referenced by
      the Relating-domain, such as "dept-example.com".  (This was called
      the "secondary" in -00.)

2.  New Resource Record Types

   We define a resource record type (RDBD) that can declare, or disavow,
   a relationship.

   RDBD also includes an optional digital signature mechanism that can
   somewhat improve the level of assurance with which an RDBD
   declaration can be handled.  This mechanism is partly modelled on how
   DKIM [RFC6376] handles public keys and signatures - a public key is
   hosted at the Relating-domain (e.g., "club.example.com"), using an
   RDBDKEY resource record, and the RDBD record of the Related-domain
   (e.g., "member.example.com") can contain a signature (verifiable with
   the "example.com" public key) over the text representation
   ('A-label') of the two names (plus a couple of other inputs).

2.1.  RDBDKEY Resource Record Definition

   The RDBDKEY record is published at the apex of the Relating-domain
   zone.

   The wire and presentation format of the RDBDKEY resource record is
   identical to the DNSKEY record.  [RFC4034]

   [[All going well, at some point we'll be able to say...]] IANA has
   allocated RR code TBD for the RDBDKEY resource record via Expert
   Review.
   [[In the meantime we're experimenting using 0xffa8, which is decimal
   65448, from the experimental RR code range, for the RDBDKEY resource
   record.]]

   The RDBDKEY RR uses the same registries as DNSKEY for its fields.
   (This follows the precedent set for CDNSKEY in [RFC7344].)

   No special processing is performed by authoritative servers or by
   resolvers, when serving or resolving.  For all practical purposes,
   RDBDKEY is a regular RR type.

   The flags field of RDBDKEY records MUST be zero.  [[Is that correct/
   ok?  I've no idea really:-)]]

   There can be multiple occurrences of the RDBDKEY resource record in
   the same zone

2.2.  RDBD Resource Record Definition

   To declare a relationship exists an RDBD resource record is published
   at the apex of the Related-domain zone.

   To disavow a relationship an RDBD resource record is published at the
   apex of the Relating-domain zone.

   [[All going well, at some point we'll be able to say...]] IANA has
   allocated RR code TBD for the RDBD resource record via Expert Review.
   [[In the meantime we're experimenting using 0xffa3, which is decimal
   65443, from the experimental RR code range, for the RDBD resource
   record.]]

   The RDBD RR is class independent.

   The RDBD RR has no special Time to Live (TTL) requirements.

   There can be multiple occurrences of the RDBD resource record in the
   same zone.

   RDBD relationships are uni-directional.  If bi-directional
   relationships exist, then both domains can publish RDBD RRs and
   optionally sign those.

   The wire format for an RDBD RDATA consists of a two octet rdbd-tag, a
   domain name or URL, and the optional signature fields which are: a
   two-octet key-tag, a one-octet signature algorithm, and the digital
   signature bits.

                           1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |           rdbd-tag            |                               /
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                               /
      /                        domain name or URL                     /
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+-+|
      |    key-tag                    | sig-alg     |                 /
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                 /
      /                            signature                          /
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   We define two possible values for the rdbd-tag in this specification,
   later specifications can define new rdbd-tag values:

   o  0: states that no relationship exists between the domains

   o  1: states that some relationship exists between the domains

Internet-Draft                    RDBD                    September 2019


   The domain name field contains either a single domain name, or an
   HTTPS URL.  In the latter case, successfully de-referencing that URL
   is expected to result in a JSON object that contains a list of domain
   names, such as is shown in the figure below.


                              [
                                  "example.com",
                                  "example.net",
                                  "foo.example"
                              ]


   If an optional signature is included, the sig-alg field MUST contain
   the signature algorithm used, with the same values used as would be
   used in an RRSIG.  The key-tag MUST match the RDBDKEY RR value for
   the corresponding public key, and is calculated as defined in
   [RFC4034] appendix B.

   If the optional signature is omitted, then the presentation form of
   the key-tag, sig-alg and signature fields MAY be omitted.  If not
   omitted then the sig-alg and key-tag fields MUST be zero and the
   signature field MUST be a an empty string.  [[Is that the right way
   to have optional fields in prsentation sytax for RRs?  Not sure.]]

   The input to signing ("to-be-signed" data) is the concatenation of
   the following linefeed-separated (where linefeed has the value
   '0x0a') lines:

                   relating=<Relating-domain name>
                   related=<Related-domain name or URL>
                   rdbd-tag=<rdbd-tag value>
                   key-tag=<key-tag>
                   sig-alg=<sig-alg>


   The Relating-domain and Related-domain values MUST be the 'A-label'
   representation of these names.

   The trailing "." representing the DNS root MUST NOT be included in
   the to-be-signed data, so a Relating-domain value above might be
   "example.com" but "example.com."  MUST NOT be used as input to
   signing.

   A linefeed MUST be included after the "sig-alg" value in the last
   line.

   [[Presentation syntax and to-be-signed details are very liable to
   change.]]

   See the examples in the Appendix for further details.

3.  RDBD processing

   o  If multiple RDBD records exist with conflicting "rdbd-tag" values,
      those RDBD records SHOULD be ignored.

   o  If an RDBD record has an invalid or undocumented "rdbd-tag", that
      RDBD record SHOULD be ignored.

   o  The document being referenced by a URL within an RDBD record MUST
      be a well-formed JSON [?RFC8259] document.  If the document does
      not validate as a JSON document, the contents of the document
      SHOULD be ignored.

   o  There is no defined maximum size for these documents, but a
      referring site ought be considerate of the retrieving entity's
      resources.

   o  When retrieving the document via HTTPS, the certificate presented
      MUST properly validate.  If the certificate fails to validate, the
      retreiving entity SHOULD ignore the contents of the file located
      at that resource.

   o  Normal HTTP processing rules apply when de-referencing a URL found
      in an RDBD record, for example, a site may employ HTTP
      redirection.

   o  Consumers of RDBD RRs MAY support signature verification.  They
      MUST be able to parse/process unsigned or signed RDBD RRs even if
      they cannot cryptographically verify signatures.

   o  Implementations producing RDBD RRs SHOULD support optional signing
      of those and production of RDBDKEY RRs.

   o  Implementations of this specification that support signing or
      verifying signatures MUST support use of RSA with SHA256 (sig-
      alg==8) with at least 2048 bit RSA keys.  [RFC5702]

   o  RSA keys MUST use a 2048 bit or longer modulus.

   o  Implementations of this specification that support signing or
      verifying signatures SHOULD support use of Ed25519 (sig-alg==15).

   o  A validated signature is solely meant to be additional evidence
      that the relevant domains are related, or that one disavows such a
      relationship.

4.  Use-cases for Signatures

   [[The signature mechanism is pretty complex, relative to anything
   else here, so it might be considered as an at-risk feature.]]

   We see two possibly interesting use-cases for the signature mechanism
   defined here.  They are not mutually exclusive.

4.1.  Many-to-one Use-Case

   If a bi-directional relationship exists between one Relating-domain
   and many Related-domains and the signature scheme is not used, then
   making the many required changes to the Relating-domain zone could be
   onerous.  Instead, the signature mechanism allows one to publish a
   stable value (the RDBDKEY) once in the Relating-domain.  Each
   Related-domain can then also publish a stable value (the RDBD RR with
   a signature) where the signature provides confirmation that both
   domains are involved in declaraing the relationship.

   This scenario also makes sense if the relationship (represented by
   the rdbd-tag) between the domains is inherently directional, for
   example, if the relationship between the Related-domains and
   Relating-domain is akin to a membership relationship.

4.2.  Extending DNSSEC

   If the Relating-domain and Related-domain zones are both DNSSEC-
   signed, then the signature mechanism defined here adds almost no
   value and so is unlikely to be worth deploying in that it provides no
   additional cryptorgraphic security (though the many-to-one advantage
   could still apply).  If neither zone is DNSSEC-signed, then again,
   there may be little value in deploying RDBD signatures.

   The minimal value that remains in either such case, is that if a
   client has acquired and cached RDBDKEY values in some secure manner,
   then the RDBD signatures do offer some benefit.  However, at this
   point it is fairly unklikely that RDBDKEY values will be acquired and
   cached via some secure out-of-band mechanisms, so we do not expect
   much deployment of RDBD signatures in either the full-DNSSEC or no-
   DNSSEC cases.

   However, where the Relating-domain's zone is DNSSEC-signed, but the
   Related-domain's zone is not DNSSEC signed, then the RDBD signatures

Internet-Draft                    RDBD                    September 2019


   do provide value, in essence by extending DNSSEC "sideways" to the
   Related-domain.  The figure below illustrates this situation.


            +-----------------+
            | Relating-domain |
            | (DNSSEC-signed) |         +---------------------+
            | RDBDKEY-1       |<----+   + Related-domain      |
            +-----------------+     |   | (NOT DNSSEC-signed) |
                                    +---+ RDBD RR with SIG    |
                                        +---------------------+

              Extending DNSSEC use-case for RDBD signatures


5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Efficiacy of signatures

   The optional signature mechanism defined here offers no protection
   against an active attack if both the RDBD and RDBDKEY values are
   accessed via an untrusted path.

5.2.  DNSSEC

   RDBD does not require DNSSEC.  Without DNSSEC it is possible for an
   attacker to falsify DNS query responses for someone investigating a
   relationship.  Conversely, an attacker could delete the response that
   would normally demonstrate the relationship, causing the
   investigating party to believe there is no link between the two
   domains.  An attacker could also replay an old RDBD value that is
   actually no longer published in the DNS by the Related-domain.

   Deploying signed records with DNSSEC should allow for detection of
   these kinds of attack.

5.3.  Lookup Loops

   A bad actor could create a loop of relationships, such as
   a.example->b.example->c.example->a.example or similar.
   Automated systems SHOULD protect against such loops.  For example,
   only perform a configured number of lookups from the first domain.
   Related-domain and Relating-domains SHOULD attempt to keep links
   direct and so that only the fewest number of lookups are needed, but
   it is understood this may not always be possible.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces two new DNS RR types, RDBD and RDBDKEY.
   [[Codepoints for those are not yet allocated by IANA, nor have
   codepoints been requested so far.]]

   [[New rdbd-tag value handling will need to be defined if we keep that
   field.  Maybe something like: 0-255: RFC required; 256-1023:
   reserved; 1024-2047: Private use; 2048-65535: FCFS.  It will also
   likely be useful to define a string representation for each
   registered rdbd-tag value, e.g.  perhaps "UNRELATED" for rdbd-tag
   value 0, and "RELATED" for rdbd-tag value 1, so that tools displaying
   RDBD information can be consistent.]]

Appendix A.  Implementation (and Toy Deployment:-) Status

   [[Note to RFC-editor: according to RFC 7942, sections such as this
   one ought not be part of the final RFC.  I still dislike that idea,
   but whatever;-)]]

   We are not aware of any independent implementations so far.  One of
   the authors has a github repo at <https://github.com/sftcd/rdbd-
   deebeedeerrr> with scripts that allow one to produce zone file
   fragments and signatures for a set of domains.  There is also a
   wrapper script for the dig tool that provides a nicer view of RDBD
   and RDBDKEY records.  See the README there for details.

   In terms of deployments, we used the above for a "toy" deployment in
   the tolerantnetworks.ie domain and other related domains that one can
   determine by following the relevant trail:-)

Appendix B.  Examples

   These examples have been generated using the proof-of-concept
   implementation mentioned above.  These are intended for interop, not
   for beauty:-) The dig wrapper script referred to above produces more
   readable output, shown further below..

   The following names and other values are used in these examples.

   o  Relating domain: my.example

   o  Related domain: my-way.example

   o  Unrelated domain: my-bad.example

Internet-Draft                    RDBD                    September 2019


   o  Made sample generation script

   o  Typo fixes etc.

D.3.  Changes from -00 to -01

   o  Changed from primary/secondary to relating/related (better
      suggestions are still welcome)

   o  Moved away from abuse of TXT RRs

   o  We now specify optional DNSSEC-like signatures (we'd be fine with
      moving back to a more DKIM-like mechanism, but wanted to see how
      this looked)

   o  Added Ed25519 option

   o  Re-worked and extended examples

D.4.  Open Issues

   Current open github issues include:

   o  #5: specify input for signing more precisely - e.g. is there a CR
      or NULL or not

   o  #6: what, if anything, does rdbd for example.com mean for
      foo.example.com?

   These can be seen at: <https://github.com/abrotman/related-domains-
