1.  Introduction

   [[Discussion of this draft is taking place on the dbound@ietf.org
   mailing list.  There's a github repo for this draft at
   <https://github.com/abrotman/related-domains-by-dns> - issues and PRs
   are welcome there.]]

   Determining relationships between registered domains can be one of
   the more difficult investigations on the Internet.  It is typical to
   see something such as "example.com" and "dept-example.com" and be
   unsure if there is an actual relationship between those two domains,
   or if one might be an attacker attempting to impersonate the other.
   In some cases, anecdotal evidence from the DNS or WHOIS/RDAP may be
   sufficient.  However, service providers of various kinds may err on
   the side of caution and treat one of the domains as untrustworthy or
   abusive because it is not clear that the two domains are in fact
   related.  This specification provides a way for one domain to
   explicitly document a relationship with another, utilizing DNS
   records.

   Possible use cases include:

   o  where a company has websites in different languages, and would
      like to correlate their ownership more easily, consider
      "example.de" and "example.ie" registered by regional offices of
      the same company;

   o  following an acquisition, a domain holder might want to indicate
      that example.net is now related to example.com in order to make a
      later migration easier;

   o  when doing Internet surveys, we should be able to provide more
      accurate results if we have information as to which domains are
      related.

   It is not a goal of this specification to provide a high-level of
   assurance that two domains are definitely related, nor to provide
   fine-grained detail about the kind of relationship that may exist
   between domains.

   Using "Related Domains By DNS", or "RDBD", it is possible to declare
   that two domains are related.

   We include an optional digital signature mechanism that can somewhat
   improve the level of assurance with which an RDBD declaration can be
   handled.  This mechanism is partly modelled on how DKIM [RFC6376]
   handles public keys and signatures - a public key is hosted at the
   relating-domain (e.g., "example.com") and a reference from the
   related-domain (e.g., "dept-example.com") contains a signature
   (verifiable with the "example.com" public key) over the text
   representation ('A-label') of the two domain names (plus a couple of
   other inputs).

   RDBD is intended to demonstrate a relationship between registered
   domains, not individual hostnames.  That is to say that the
   relationship should exist between "example.com" and "dept-
   example.com", not "foo.example.com" and "bar.dept-example.com" (where
   those latter two are hosts).

   There already exists Vouch By Reference (VBR) [RFC5518], however this
   only applies to email.  RDBD could be a more general purpose solution
   that could be applied to other use cases, as well as for SMTP
   transactions.

   This document describes the various options, how to create records,
   and the method of validation, if the option to use digital signatures
   is chosen.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   The following terms are used throughout this document:

   o  Relating-domain: this refers to the domain that is declarating a
      relationship exists.  (This was called the "parent/primary" in
      -00).

   o  Related-domain: This refers to the domain that is referenced by
      the relating-domain, such as "dept-example.com".  (This was called
      the "secondary" in -00.)

2.  New Resource Record Types

   We define two new RRTYPES, an optional one for the relating-domain
   (RDBDKEY) to store a public key for when signatures are in use and
   one for use in related-domains (RDBD).

2.1.  RDBDKEY Resource Record Definition

   The RDBDKEY record is published at the apex of the relating-domain
   zone.

   The wire and presentation format of the RDBDKEY resource record is
   identical to the DNSKEY record.  [RFC4034]

   [[All going well, at some point we'll be able to say...]] IANA has
   allocated RR code TBD for the RDBDKEY resource record via Expert
   Review.

   The RDBDKEY RR uses the same registries as DNSKEY for its fields.
   (This follows the precedent set for CDNSKEY in [RFC7344].)

   No special processing is performed by authoritative servers or by
   resolvers, when serving or resolving.  For all practical purposes,
   RDBDKEY is a regular RR type.

   The flags field of RDBDKEY records MUST be zero.  [[Is that correct/
   ok?  I've no idea really:-)]]

2.2.  RDBD Resource Record Definition

   The RDBD resource record is published at the apex of the related-
   domain zone.

   [[All going well, at some point we'll be able to say...]] IANA has
   allocated RR code TBD for the RDBD resource record via Expert Review.

   The RDBD RR is class independent.

   The RDBD RR has no special Time to Live (TTL) requirements.

   The wire format for an RDBD RDATA consists of a two octet rdbd-tag,
   the relating-domain name, and the optional signature fields which
   are: a two-octet key-tag, a one-octet signature algorithm, and the
   digital signature bits.

                           1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |           rdbd-tag            |                               /
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                               /
      /                         relating-domain name                  /
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+-+|
      |    key-tag                    | sig-alg     |                 /
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                 /
      /                            signature                          /
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The rdbd-tag field MUST contain the value zero.  Later specifications
   can define new rdbd-tag values.

   If an optional signature is included, the sig-alg field MUST contain
   the signature algorithm used, with the same values used as would be
   used in an RRSIG.  The key-tag MUST match the RDBDKEY RR value for
   the corresponding public key.

   If the optional signature is omitted, then the presentation form of
   the key-tag, sig-alg and signature fields MAY be omitted.  If not
   omitted then the sig-alg and key-tag fields MUST be zero and the
   signature field MUST be a an empty string.  [[Is that the right way
   to have optional fields in RRs?  Not sure.]]

   The input to signing ("to-be-signed" data) is the concatenation of
   the following linefeed-separated (where linefeed has the value
   '0x0a') lines:

                        relating=<relating-domain>
                        related=<related-domain>
                        rdbd-tag=<rdbd-tag value>

                        sig-alg=<sig-alg>


   The relating-domain and related-domain values MUST be the 'A-label'
   representation of these names.

   The trailing "." representing the DNS root MUST NOT be included in
   the to-be-signed data, so a relating-domain value above might be
   "example.com" but "example.com."  MUST NOT be used as input to
   signing.

   A linefeed MUST be included after the "sig-alg" value in the last
   line.

   [[Presentation syntax and to-be-signed details are very liable to
   change.]]

   See the examples in the Appendix for further details.

3.  Directionality and Cardinality

   RDBD relationships are uni-directional.  If bi-directional
   relationships exist, then both domains can publish RDBD RRs and
   optionally sign those.

   If one domain has relationships with many others, then the relevant
   RDBD RRs (and RDBDKEY RRs) can be published to represent those.

4.  Required Signature Algorithms

   Consumers of RDBD RRs MAY support signature verification.  They MUST
   be able to parse/process unsigned or signed RDBD RRs even if they
   cannot cryptographically verify signatures.

   Implementations producing RDBD RRs SHOULD support optional signing of
   those and production of RDBDKEY RRs.

   Implementations of this specification that support signing or
   verifying signatures MUST support use of RSA with SHA256 (sig-alg==8)
   with at least 2048 bit RSA keys.  [RFC5702]

   RSA keys SHOULD use a 2048 bit or longer modulus.

Internet-Draft                    RDBD                        April 2019


   Implementations of this specification that support signing or
   verifying signatures SHOULD support use of Ed25519 (sig-alg==15).
   [RFC8080][RFC8032]

5.  Validation

   A validated signature is solely meant to be additional evidence that
   the two domains are related.  The existence of this relationship is
   not meant to state that the data from either domain should be
   considered as more trustworthy.

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Efficiacy of signatures

   The optional signature mechanism defined here offers no protection
   against an active attack if both the RDBD and RDBDKEY values are
   accessed via an untrusted path.

   If the RDBDKEY value has been cached, or is otherwise known via some
   sufficiently secure mechanism, then the RDBD signature does confirm
   that the holder of the private key (presumably the relating-domain)
   considered that the relationship with the related-domain was real at
   some point in time.

6.2.  DNSSEC

   RDBD does not require DNSSEC.  Without DNSSEC it is possible for an
   attacker to falsify DNS query responses for someone investigating a
   relationship.  Conversely, an attacker could delete the response that
   would normally demonstrate the relationship, causing the
   investigating party to believe there is no link between the two
   domains.  An attacker could also replay an old RDBD value that is
   actually no longer published in the DNS by the related-domain.

   Deploying signed records with DNSSEC should allow for detection of
   these kinds of attack.

   If the relating-domain has DNSSEC deployed, but the related-domain
   does not, then the optional signature can (in a sense) extend the
   DNSSEC chain to cover the RDBD RR in the related-domain's zone.

   If both domains have DNSSEC deployed, and if the relating-domain
   public key has been cached, then the the signature mechanism provides
   additional protection against active attacks involving a parent of
   one of the domains.  Such attacks may in any case be less likely and
   detectable in many scenarios as they would be generic attacks against
   DNSSEC-signing (e.g. if a regisgtry injected a bogus DS for a

   relating-domain into the registry's signed zone).  If the public key
   from the relevant RDNDKEY RRs is read from the DNS at the same time
   as a related RDBD RR, then the signature mechanism provided here may
   provide litle additional value over and above DNSSEC.

6.3.  Lookup Loops

   It's conceivable that an attacker could create a loop of
   relationships, such as a.com->b.com->c.com->a.com or similar.  This
   could cause a resource issue for any automated system.  A system
   SHOULD only perform three lookups from the first domain
   (a.com->b.com->c.com->d.com).  The related and relating-domains
   SHOULD attempt to keep links direct and so that only the fewest
   number of lookups are needed, but it is understood this may not
   always be possible.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces two new DNS RR types, RDBD and RDBDKEY.
   [[Codepoints for those are not yet allocated by IANA, nor have
   codepoints been requested so far.]]

   [[New rdbd-tag value handling wll need to be defined if we keep that
   field.  Maybe something like: 0-255: RFC required; 256-1023:
   reserved; 1024-2047: Private use; 2048-65535: FCFS.]]

A.3.  Sample Ed25519 Signature

   Since OpenSSL does not yet support Ed25519 singing via its command
   line tool, we generate our example using the python script below.
   This uses the python library from Appendix A of [RFC8032].

   o  We now specify optional DNSSEC-like signatures (we'd be fine with
      moving back to a more DKIM-like mechanism, but wanted to see how
      this looked)

   o  Added Ed25519 option

   o  Re-worked and extended examples

B.3.  Open Issues

   Current open github issues include:

   o  #5: specify input for signing more precisely - e.g. is there a CR
      or NULL or not

   o  #6: what, if anything, does rdbd for example.com mean for
      foo.example.com?
