1.  Introduction

   [[There's a github repo for this -- issues and PRs are welcome there.
   <https://github.com/abrotman/related-domains-by-dns>

   Current issues include:

   o  #1: use TXT or new RR?  (ATB: new RR, but TXT for now)

   o  #2: stick with a 1:n thing or design for m:n relationshops (ATB:
      m:n is possible (I believe) as it stands, using selectors)

   o  #3: include an indicator for the kind of relationship or not?

   o  #4: "h=" is wrong for a signature, but "s=" is selector, bikeshed
      later

   o  #5: specify input for signing more precisely - e.g. is there a CR
      or NULL or not

   These aren't yet github issues:

   o  #N: make sure we say explicitly where child's TXT RR is below
      _rdbd.example.net (if we stick with TXT)

   o  #N: keep an eye on <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-
      dnsop-attrleaf> and add entry there if using the "_rdbd" prefix.

   o  #N: various design suggestions from JL (involving ditching
      signatures:-)

   o  #N: don't overloaad parent/primary and secondary - invent some new
      terms

   o  #N: stick with unidirectional or make it bidirectional?  (AOS)

   Determining relationships between registered domains can be one of
   the more difficult investigations on the Internet.  It is typical to
   see something such as "example.com" and "dept-example.com" and be
   unsure if there is an actual relationship between those two domains,
   or if one might be an attacker attempting to impersonate the other.
   In some cases, anecdotal evidence from places such as DNS or WHOIS/
   RDAP may suffice.  However, service providers of various kinds may
   err on the side of caution and mark the secondary domain being
   untrustworthy or abusive because it is not clear that they are in
   fact related.  Another possible use case could be where a company has
   two websites in different languages, and would like to correlate
   their ownership more easily, consider "example.at" and "example.de"
   registered by regional offices of the same company.  A third example
   could be an acquisition where both domains continue to operate.

   Using "Related Domains By DNS", or "RDBD", it is possible to indicate
   that the secondary domain is related to the primary domain.  This
   mechanism is modelled on how DKIM [RFC6376] handles public keys and
   signatures - a public key is hosted at the parent domain
   ("example.com") and a reference from the secondary domain ("dept-
   example.com") contains a signature (verifiable with the "example.com"
   public key) over the text representation ('A-label') of the primmary
   and secondary domain names.

   RDBD is intended to demonstrate a relationship between registered
   domains, not individual hostnames.  That is to say that the
   relationship should exist between "example.com" and "dept-
   example.com", not "foo.example.com" and "bar.dept-example.com".

   There already exists Vouch By Reference (VBR) [RFC5518], however this
   only applies to email.  RDBD could be a more general purpose solution
   that could be applied to other use cases, as well as for SMTP
   transactions.

   This document describes the various options, how to create a record,
   and the method of validation.

Internet-Draft                    RDBD                     February 2019


1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   The following terms are used throughout this document:

   o  Parent domain: This refers to the domain that is to be referenced,
      such as "example.com".

   o  Secondary domain: This will refer to the domain that references
      the parent domain, such as "dept-example.com".

2.  DNS Record for Secondary Domain

   There are a few options when publishing the reference to the parent
   domain.

   o  "v": Version string, which should be set to "RDBD1".

   o  "d": The Parent Domain.  This should be in the form of
      "example.com".

   o  "s": The selector, which is the same as defined in [RFC6376] and
      used to denote which published public key should be used.

   o  "h": The base64 encoded signature over the primary and secondary
      domain namess, created using the private key.

   A sample TXT record for "dept-example.com" would appear as:

   "v=RDBD1;s=2018a;d=example.com;
   h=TkKgbCV7xXWYES+I5y8KRvgQet7SOLUYTbJtjVyb2/H/

   m2nYjnaCi8P9o3y2nBn1rfzuHB2ctPnnTqK+eg=="

   The input to signing is:

   s=dept-example.com&p=example.com

   Where:

   s: The secondary domain p: The primary domain

   For internationalised domain names, the punycode ('A-label') version
   is the input to signing.

3.  DNS Record for Parent Domain

   o  "v": Version string, which should be set to "RDBD1".

   o  "s": The selector, which is the same as defined in [RFC6376] and
      is a string used to denote a specific public key published by the
      Parent Domain.

   o  "k": The public key published for this selector, encoded using
      base64.

   A sample TXT record for the parent domain of "example.com":

   "v=RDBD1;s=2018a;
   k=MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEA2LNjBAdNAtZOMdd3hl

   fVwrs4495a8OUkOBy7V4YkgKbFYSSkGPmhWoPbV7hCQjEAURWLM9J7EUou3U1WIq
   Tj1QIDAQAB"

   And the TXT location for this record would be:

   "2018a._rdbd.example.com"

   This is constructed by using the selector (s=) in the secondary
   domain's reference to the first domain.  The absence of the record in
   this location MUST be considered a failure to validate, and a failure
   to establish the relationship.

4.  Validation

   The validated signature is solely meant to be evidence that the two
   domains are related.  The existence of this relationship is not meant
   to state that the data from either domain should be considered as
   more trustworthy.

5.  Steps to validate

   A validating system should use the combination of the Secondary
   Domain name and public key from the Parent Domain record to be able
   to verify the signature that is stored in the record for the
   Secondary Domain.  This is demonstrated in the appendix.

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  DNSSEC

   RDND does not require DNSSEC.  It could be possible for an attacker
   to falsify DNS query responses for someone investigating a
   relationship.  Conversely, an attacker could delete the response that
   would normally demonstrate the relationship, causing the
   investigating party to believe there is no link between the two
   domains.

   Deploying signed records with DNSSEC should allow for detection of
   either attack.

6.2.  Lookup Loops

   It's conceivable that an attacker could create a loop of lookups,
   such as a.com->b.com->c.com->a.com or similar.  This could cause a
   resource issue for any automated system.  A system SHOULD only
   perform three lookups from the original domain
   (a.com->b.com->c.com->d.com).  The Secondary and Parent SHOULD
   attempt to keep the link direct and limited to a single lookup, but
   it is understood this may not always be possible.

7.  References

7.1.  Normative References

              RFC 6376, DOI 10.17487/RFC6376, September 2011,

7.2.  Informative References

              <https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc5518>.

Appendix A.  Creating a Signature for the Secondary Domain

   Appendix C of [RFC6376] has some reference material on how to create
   a set of keys for use in this type of use case.  The key length is
   recommended to be at least 2048 bits instead of the 1024 recommended
   in that appendix.
