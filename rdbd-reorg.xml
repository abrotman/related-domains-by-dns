<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>Determining relationships between DNS domains can be one of the more difficult
investigations on the Internet.  It is typical to see something such as
<spanx style="verb">example.com</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">dept-example.com</spanx> and be unsure if there is an actual
relationship between those two domains, or if one might be an attacker
attempting to impersonate the other.  In some cases, anecdotal evidence from
the DNS or WHOIS/RDAP may be sufficient.  However, service providers of various
kinds may err on the side of caution and treat one of the domains as
untrustworthy or abusive if it is not clear that the two domains are in
fact related. This specification provides a way for one domain to
explicitly document, or disavow, a relationship other domains, utilizing DNS records.
</t>
<t>The use cases for this include:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>where an organisation has names below different ccTLDs, and would like to
allow others to correlate their ownership more easily, consider <spanx style="verb">example.de</spanx>
and <spanx style="verb">example.ie</spanx> registered by regional offices of the same company;</t>
<t>following an acquisition, a domain holder might want to indicate that
example.net is now related to example.com in order to make a later migration
easier;</t>
<t>when doing Internet surveys, we should be able to provide more accurate
results if we have information as to which domains are, or are not, related.</t>
<t>a domain holder may wish to declare that no relationship exists with some
other domain, for example &quot;good.example&quot; may want to declare that it is not
associated with &quot;g00d.example&quot; if the latter is currently being used in some
cousin-domain style attack. In such cases, it is more likely that there can be
a larger list of names (compared to the &quot;positive&quot; use-cases) for which there
is a desire to disavow a relationship.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>It is not a goal of this specification to provide a high-level of
assurance as to whether or not two domains are definitely related, nor to provide
fine-grained detail about the kinds of relationships that may
exist between domains. However, the mechanism defined here is
extensible in a way that should allow use-cases calling for such
declarations to be handled later.

<xref target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>
<t>The following terms are used throughout this document:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Relating-domain: this refers to the domain that is
declarating a relationship exists. (This was called the
&quot;parent/primary&quot; in -00).</t>
<t>Related-domain: This refers to the domain that is
referenced by the Relating-domain, such as <spanx style="verb">dept-example.com</spanx>.

<section anchor="new-resource-record-types" title="New Resource Record Types">
<t>We define a resource record type (RDBD) that can declare, or disavow, a
relationship.
</t>
<t>RDBD also includes an optional digital signature mechanism that can somewhat
improve the level of assurance with which an RDBD declaration can be handled.
This mechanism is partly modelled on how DKIM <xref target="RFC6376"/> handles public keys
and signatures - a public key is hosted at the Relating-domain (e.g.,
<spanx style="verb">club.example.com</spanx>), using an RDBDKEY resource record, and the RDBD record of
the Related-domain (e.g., <spanx style="verb">member.example.com</spanx>) can contain a signature
(verifiable with the <spanx style="verb">example.com</spanx> public key) over the text representation
('A-label') of the two names (plus a couple of other inputs).
</t>

<section anchor="rdbdkey-resource-record-definition" title="RDBDKEY Resource Record Definition">
<t>The RDBDKEY record is published at the apex of the Relating-domain zone.
</t>
<t>The wire and presentation format of the RDBDKEY
resource record is identical to the DNSKEY record. <xref target="RFC4034"/>
</t>
<t>[[All going well, at some point we'll be able to say...]]
IANA has allocated RR code TBD for the RDBDKEY resource record via Expert
Review.
<vspace/>
[[In the meantime we're experimenting using 0xffa8, which is decimal 65448,
from the experimental RR code range, for the RDBDKEY resource record.]]
</t>
<t>The RDBDKEY RR uses the same registries as DNSKEY for its
fields. (This follows the precedent set for CDNSKEY in <xref target="RFC7344"/>.)
</t>
<t>No special processing is performed by authoritative servers or by
resolvers, when serving or resolving.  For all practical purposes,
RDBDKEY is a regular RR type.
</t>
<t>The flags field of RDBDKEY records MUST be zero. [[Is that correct/ok? I've
no idea really:-)]]
</t>
<t>There can be multiple occurrences of the RDBDKEY resource record in the
same zone

<section anchor="rdbd-resource-record-definition" title="RDBD Resource Record Definition">
<t>To declare a relationship exists an RDBD resource record is published at the

</t>
<t>The RDBD RR is class independent.
</t>
<t>The RDBD RR has no special Time to Live (TTL) requirements.
</t>
<t>There can be multiple occurrences of the RDBD resource record in the

</t>
<t>RDBD relationships are uni-directional. If bi-directional relationships
exist, then both domains can publish RDBD RRs and optionally sign those.
</t>
<t>The wire format for an RDBD RDATA consists of a two octet rdbd-tag, a
domain name or URL, and the optional signature fields which are: a two-octet
key-tag, a one-octet signature algorithm, and the digital signature bits.

<t>We define two possible values for the rdbd-tag in this specification,
later specifications can define new rdbd-tag values:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>0: states that no relationship exists between the domains</t>
<t>1: states that some relationship exists between the domains</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>The domain name field contains either a single domain
name, or an HTTPS URL. In the latter case, successfully de-referencing that
URL is expected to result in a JSON object that contains a list of domain
names, such as is shown in the figure below.
</t>

<figure align="center"><artwork align="center" type="ascii-art">

    [ 
        "example.com", 
        "example.net",
        "foo.example"
    ]
    
</artwork></figure>
<t>If an optional signature is included, the sig-alg field MUST contain
the signature algorithm used, with the same values used as would be
used in an RRSIG. The key-tag MUST match the RDBDKEY RR value for
the corresponding public key, and is calculated as defined in
<xref target="RFC4034"/> appendix B.
</t>
<t>If the optional signature is omitted, then the presentation form of the
key-tag, sig-alg and signature fields MAY be omitted. If not omitted then the
sig-alg and key-tag fields MUST be zero and the signature field MUST be a an
empty string. [[Is that the right way to have optional fields in prsentation
sytax for RRs? Not sure.]]
</t>
<t>The input to signing (&quot;to-be-signed&quot; data) is the concatenation of the
following linefeed-separated (where linefeed has the value '0x0a') lines:
</t>

<figure align="center"><artwork align="center" type="ascii-art">
relating=&lt;Relating-domain name&gt;
related=&lt;Related-domain name or URL&gt;
rdbd-tag=&lt;rdbd-tag value&gt;
key-tag=&lt;key-tag&gt;
sig-alg=&lt;sig-alg&gt;

</artwork></figure>
<t>The Relating-domain and Related-domain values MUST be the 'A-label'
representation of these names.
</t>
<t>The trailing &quot;.&quot; representing the DNS root MUST NOT be included in
the to-be-signed data, so a Relating-domain value above might be
&quot;example.com&quot; but &quot;example.com.&quot; MUST NOT be used as input to
signing.
</t>
<t>A linefeed MUST be included after the &quot;sig-alg&quot; value in the
last line.
</t>
<t>[[Presentation syntax and to-be-signed details are very liable to change.]]

<section anchor="usecases-for-signatures" title="Use-cases for Signatures">
<t>[[The signature mechanism is pretty complex, relative to anything
else here, so it might be considered as an at-risk feature.]]
</t>
<t>We see two possibly interesting use-cases for the signature mechanism
defined here. They are not mutually exclusive.
</t>

<section anchor="manytoone-usecase" title="Many-to-one Use-Case">
<t>If a bi-directional relationship exists between one Relating-domain and many
Related-domains and the signature scheme is not used, then making the many
required changes to the Relating-domain zone could be onerous. Instead, the
signature mechanism allows one to publish a stable value (the RDBDKEY) once in
the Relating-domain.  Each Related-domain can then also publish a stable value
(the RDBD RR with a signature) where the signature provides confirmation that
both domains are involved in declaraing the relationship.
</t>
<t>This scenario also makes sense if the relationship (represented by the rdbd-tag)
between the domains is inherently directional, for example, if the relationship
between the Related-domains and Relating-domain is akin to a membership
relationship.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="extending-dnssec" title="Extending DNSSEC">
<t>If the Relating-domain and Related-domain zones are both DNSSEC-signed, then
the signature mechanism defined here adds almost no value and so is unlikely to
be worth deploying in that it provides no additional cryptorgraphic security
(though the many-to-one advantage could still apply).
If neither zone is DNSSEC-signed,
then again, there may be little value in deploying RDBD signatures.
</t>
<t>The minimal value that remains in either such case, is that if a client
has acquired and cached RDBDKEY values in some secure manner,
then the RDBD signatures do offer some benefit. However, at this
point it is fairly unklikely that RDBDKEY values will be acquired
and cached via some secure out-of-band mechanisms, so we do not
expect much deployment of RDBD signatures in either the full-DNSSEC
or no-DNSSEC cases.
</t>
<t>However, where the Relating-domain's zone is DNSSEC-signed, but the
Related-domain's zone is not DNSSEC signed, then the RDBD signatures
do provide value, in essence by extending DNSSEC &quot;sideways&quot; to the
Related-domain. The figure below illustrates this situation.
</t>

<figure align="center"><artwork align="center" type="ascii-art">

<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">

<section anchor="efficiacy-of-signatures" title="Efficiacy of signatures">
<t>The optional signature mechanism defined here offers no protection against an
active attack if both the RDBD and RDBDKEY values are accessed via an untrusted
path.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="dnssec" title="DNSSEC">
<t>RDBD does not require DNSSEC. Without DNSSEC it is possible for an attacker to
falsify DNS query responses for someone investigating a relationship.
Conversely, an attacker could delete the response that would normally
demonstrate the relationship, causing the investigating party to believe there
is no link between the two domains.  An attacker could also replay an old RDBD
value that is actually no longer published in the DNS by the Related-domain.
</t>
<t>Deploying signed records with DNSSEC should allow for detection
of these kinds of attack.

<section anchor="lookup-loops" title="Lookup Loops">
<t>A bad actor could create a loop of relationships, such as
a.example-&gt;b.example-&gt;c.example-&gt;a.example or similar.
<vspace/>
Automated systems SHOULD protect against such loops. For example,
only perform a configured number of lookups from the first
domain.
Related-domain and Relating-domains
SHOULD attempt to keep links direct and so that only the fewest number of
lookups are needed, but it is understood this may not always be possible.

<t>This document introduces two new DNS RR types, RDBD and RDBDKEY.  [[Codepoints
for those are not yet allocated by IANA, nor have codepoints been requested so
far.]]
</t>
<t>[[New rdbd-tag value handling will need to be defined if we keep that field.
Maybe something like: 0-255: RFC required; 256-1023: reserved; 1024-2047:
Private use; 2048-65535: FCFS. It will also likely be useful to define a string
representation for each registered rdbd-tag value, e.g.  perhaps &quot;UNRELATED&quot;
for rdbd-tag value 0, and &quot;RELATED&quot; for rdbd-tag value 1, so that tools
displaying RDBD information can be consistent.]]
